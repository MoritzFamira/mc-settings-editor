# mc-settings-editor
This is a program with which you can edit Minecraft's "options.txt" file from outside the game. It also allows you to create multiple profiles to quickly and easily apply settings with a single click that will then be used when starting the game.

This is quite convenient compared to manually entering your preferred settings, which sadly is necessary if you like to play different versions of the game, since older versions don't include some of the settings used in newer versions, or treat values stored in "options.txt" differently for some reason.
